=head1 NAME

raps2 - "Right, Another Password Store" take two

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<raps2> I<action> I<args ...>

=head1 VERSION

This manual documents B<raps2> version 0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

raps2 is a simple password safe.  You give it a name, a password and optional
metadata, and it will encrypt and store them for you.  You probably want to
start with C<< raps2 add accountname >>, and then later use C<< raps2 get
accountname >> and paste the corresponding password into whatever application
requires it.  B<raps2> will automatically initialize its store when used for
the first time.

=head1 ACTIONS

=over

=item B<add> I<account>

Adds I<account> to the store.  It will ask you for the store's master
password, some metadata and the new password and then store them.  Note that
only the password is encrypted, the metadata is saved as clear-text.

=item B<dump> I<account>

Dump everything saved for I<account>, including the clear-text password, to
stdout.

=item B<get> I<account>

Decrypt I<account>'s password and store it in the X Clipboard.  Note that it
can only be pasted once.

=item B<info> I<account>

Show information about I<account>, does not require the master password.

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

zero on success, non-zero otherwise.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

raps2 saves the master password hash in F<~/.config/raps2/password>.

Additional encrypted passwords are stored in F<~/.local/share/raps2/>.
