=head1 NAME

raps2 - "Right, Another Password Store" take two

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<raps2> I<action> I<args ...>

=head1 VERSION

This manual documents B<raps2> version 0.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

raps2 is a simple password safe.  You give it a name, a password and optional
metadata, and it will encrypt and store them for you.  You probably want to
start with C<< raps2 add accountname >>, and then later use C<< raps2 get
accountname >> and paste the corresponding password into whatever application
requires it.  B<raps2> will automatically initialize its store when used for
the first time.

Supported metadata are "URL", "Login" and the multiline "Extra" field.  URL
and Login will be saved as plaintext, Extra is encrypted like the password.

=head1 ACTIONS
